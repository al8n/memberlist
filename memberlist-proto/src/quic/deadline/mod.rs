//! Incremental earliest-deadline index for the QUIC coordinator's
//! `poll_timeout`.
//!
//! Production drivers (reactor, compio) re-poll `QuicEndpoint::poll_timeout`
//! after every inbound receive batch, so it must not fold an
//! O(connections + bridges + dials) minimum per call — corrupted or replayed
//! traffic would otherwise force that scan per batch. This index keeps the
//! minimum incrementally: each deadline source registers its next deadline
//! under a [`TimerKey`], and `earliest` reads the live minimum in O(log n).
//!
//! **Storage is proportional to the LIVE key count, not the update rate.**
//! quinn resets a connection's idle deadline on every authenticated packet, so
//! sustained valid traffic churns `Conn` deadlines. The ordered map is keyed by
//! `(deadline, generation)`, and [`DeadlineIndex::current`] is a reverse lookup
//! from a key to the `(deadline, generation)` it currently occupies. `set`
//! removes a key's prior ordered entry before inserting its new one, so a key
//! whose deadline moves never leaves a stale entry behind — the space cannot
//! grow with the number of updates the way a lazy heap of tombstones would.
//! Every entry in [`DeadlineIndex::by_deadline`] is therefore live, and
//! `earliest` reads the first ordered key with no discard loop.
